# Oscail &mdash; An Octopress theme

Oscail is a light and clean theme for use on [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) sites. The theme can be viewed in action on [my personal site](http://coog.ie/).

## Installation

You can install Oscail like so:
    $ cd your_octopress_directory
    $ git clone https://github.com/coogie/oscail.git .themes/oscail
    $ rake install['oscail']
    $ rake generate

## To-do

There is a lot left to do on this them and I will be adding a list here with a bunch of things that need adding or fixing.
If there is anything you'd like to fix yourself, or anything that you wish to add, then by all means create an issue or a pull request!
